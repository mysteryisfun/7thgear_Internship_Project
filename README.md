Project Title
Intelligent Data Extraction System
Introduction
The Intelligent Data Extraction System is an advanced solution designed to automate the extraction of text, images, and diagrams from virtual meeting slides. By associating this data with timestamps and generating concise, searchable summaries, the system eliminates the inefficiency of manual extraction. It enhances team productivity and ensures critical meeting insights—such as project updates, charts, and plans—are readily accessible. Virtual meetings are a cornerstone of modern collaboration, and this system transforms their multimedia data into actionable outputs.
Objectives

Automation: Fully automate the extraction of slide content to eliminate manual effort.
Comprehensive Data Capture: Extract text, images, diagrams, and potentially audio, each linked to precise timestamps.
Actionable Outputs: Generate concise, searchable summaries to streamline meeting follow-ups and task assignments.
Scalability and Integration: Ensure compatibility with platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, and scale to process multiple concurrent meetings efficiently.

Approach Overview
The system employs a hybrid approach integrating four core components:

Video Processing: Preprocess meeting videos to isolate key frames with slide content.
Text Extraction: Extract and refine text from slides using OCR and NLP techniques.
Image and Diagram Handling: Analyze and describe visual elements with machine learning models.
Information Merging: Combine extracted data into unified, timestamped summaries.

This methodology ensures comprehensive capture of both textual and visual information.
Technical Stack
The system leverages a robust suite of tools tailored to each component:

Video Processing: OpenCV (frame analysis), FFmpeg (video handling), PySceneDetect (scene detection).
Text Extraction: Tesseract (open-source OCR), Google Cloud Vision API (advanced OCR), custom CNN models (text recognition), spaCy (NLP postprocessing).
Image and Diagram Handling: ResNet (image classification), YOLO (object detection), BLIP (image captioning), ChartOCR (diagram parsing), Vision APIs (e.g., GPT-4, Google Gemini for complex visuals).
Information Merging: BART (text summarization), LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI 4.0/4.1, Gemini-2.5, Grok-3 for advanced summarization).
NLP Libraries: For text cleanup, entity recognition, and summarization enhancement.

These tools collectively enable efficient multimedia data processing and scalability.
Detailed Approach
1. Video Processing

Goal: Identify and preprocess key frames containing slide content.
Methods:
Use PySceneDetect to detect scene changes (e.g., slide transitions) based on visual thresholds.
Apply OpenCV to isolate the presentation area, excluding irrelevant elements like camera feeds or sidebars.
Reduce frame rate to 1 frame per second using FFmpeg (from typical 30 fps) to optimize processing.


Significance: Focuses computational resources on relevant frames, reducing redundancy.

2. Text Extraction

Goal: Extract accurate, clean text from slide images.
Methods:
Perform OCR using Tesseract (cost-effective) or Google Cloud Vision API (high accuracy).
Postprocess with spaCy to correct OCR errors, remove noise, and standardize text.
Skip unchanged frames (detected via frame differencing) to avoid redundant extraction.


Significance: Forms the textual backbone for downstream summarization and searchability.

3. Image and Diagram Handling

Goal: Interpret and describe visual elements (images and diagrams) on slides.
Methods:
ResNet: Classify visuals into categories (e.g., image vs. diagram).
Diagrams: Parse with OpenCV or ChartOCR to generate descriptions (e.g., "Pie chart: 50% R&D, 30% Marketing").
Images: Caption with YOLO (object detection) or BLIP (e.g., "New phone prototype").
Use Vision APIs (e.g., GPT-4) for complex or ambiguous visuals as an optional enhancement.
Filter duplicates using image hashing (e.g., perceptual hashing) to avoid redundancy.


Significance: Captures insights from visuals that complement textual data.

4. Merging Information

Goal: Integrate all extracted data into a cohesive, timestamped summary.
Methods:
Align text, visual descriptions, and (if included) audio transcripts by timestamp.
Generate summaries using BART (transformer-based) or LLM APIs for natural, concise outputs.
Produce a structured metadata file (e.g., JSON) for searchability and integration.


Significance: Delivers a unified, actionable overview of the meeting.

Integration and Scalability

Integration:
Connect to platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet for real-time slide capture via APIs or screen-sharing streams.
Link to productivity tools (Asana, Trello) for automated task creation from summaries.


Scalability:
Deploy on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) for parallel processing.
Implement batch processing and caching to handle high volumes efficiently.


Purpose: Ensures seamless workflow integration and capacity for growth.

Implementation Considerations

Accuracy: Prioritize high precision in extraction and summarization.
Simplicity: Design intuitive outputs (e.g., summaries, dashboards) for end users.
Security: Safeguard data with encryption and rigorous testing.
Flexibility: Adapt to various platforms and slide formats.
Performance: Maintain low latency under high loads.
Feedback Loops: Incorporate user feedback for iterative improvement.

Testing Strategies

Unit Testing:
Tool: pytest
Scope: Validate individual functions (e.g., OCR accuracy >95%).
Frequency: Run on every commit via CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions).


Integration Testing:
Scope: Test end-to-end workflows (e.g., video → text → visual → summary → Asana task).
Method: Use synthetic meeting data with diverse slide types (text-heavy, image-based, animated).


Performance Testing:
Scope: Simulate 1,000 concurrent users processing 10,000 slides/hour.
Target: Maintain performance with <5% latency increase.



A continuous feedback loop post-testing will refine system performance.

Module-Specific Details
1. Presentation Area Detection

Process: Use OpenCV with grayscale conversion, edge detection (Canny algorithm), and contour analysis; fallback to YOLOv5 for complex layouts (e.g., split-screens).

3. Image Classification

Tools: Fine-tuned ResNet-50 (image categorization) or Visual LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.0 for detailed descriptions).
Output: Descriptions like "Bar chart: Sales trends 2023" or "Photo: Team meeting."

4. NLP for Summarization

Tools: Fine-tuned BART or LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI 4.1).
Process: Aggregate slide text, visual descriptions, and audio (if available) into concise summaries.

Challenges and Solutions

Video Processing:
