# Intelligent Data Extraction System - Implementation Phases

This document outlines the software development phases for our Intelligent Data Extraction System project. Each phase includes detailed steps, technical requirements, and expected deliverables. This structured approach ensures systematic development while maintaining code quality and project organization.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Environment Configuration

### Objectives:
- Set up the development environment
- Configure necessary dependencies
- Establish project structure

### Steps:
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create virtual environment for isolated dependency management
   - Set up Git repository with appropriate branching strategy
   - Configure linting and code formatting tools

2. **Dependency Installation**
   - Install core libraries: OpenCV, FFmpeg, PySceneDetect, PaddleOCR, spaCy
   - Configure cloud API access (Google Cloud Vision, LLM APIs)
   - Verify all installations with simple test scripts

3. **Project Structure Creation**
   - Establish core module directories: video_processing, text_extraction, image_handling, info_merging
   - Create utility folders: utils, tests, docs, config
   - Set up logging framework for debugging and monitoring

### Deliverables:
- Functioning virtual environment with all dependencies
- Well-structured project directory
- Configuration files for different environments (dev, test, prod)
- Requirements.txt file documenting all dependencies
- Basic README updates with setup instructions

### Testing:
- Validate environment setup with simple scripts testing each major dependency
- Ensure logging system captures appropriate information

## Phase 2: Video Processing Module Development

### Objectives:
- Implement frame extraction from meeting videos
- Detect scene changes and slide transitions
- Isolate presentation areas within frames

### Steps:
1. **Frame Extraction Implementation**
   - Develop FFmpeg integration for video decoding
   - Implement frame rate reduction (30fps â†’ 1fps)
   - Create frame storage mechanism with timestamp preservation

2. **Scene Detection Implementation**
   - Replace Tesseract OCR with PaddleOCR for text extraction
   - Develop custom scene detection logic using `SequenceMatcher`
   - Configure similarity threshold for scene change detection

3. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test with sample videos to validate frame extraction and scene detection
   - Debug and optimize for performance

### Deliverables:
- Frame extraction module with FFmpeg integration
- Scene detection module using PaddleOCR and custom logic
- Configurable parameters for frame rate and similarity threshold

### Testing:
- Validate frame extraction with various video formats
- Test scene detection accuracy with different similarity thresholds
