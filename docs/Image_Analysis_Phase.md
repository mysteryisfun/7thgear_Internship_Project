Absolutely. Below is a **detailed phase-by-phase development plan** for your frame analysis system based on your updated flowchart. It includes two image classifiers and downstream logic excluding the already completed text processing.

## üîÅ **PHASE 1: FRAME EXTRACTION FROM VIDEO**

### **Objective:**

Extract representative image frames from the recorded meeting video at a controlled interval (e.g., 1 frame per second) to feed into the pipeline.

### **Steps:**

1. **Select suitable FPS** for frame extraction (e.g., 1fps or 0.5fps) to balance performance and coverage.
2. **Read video stream** and extract frames using a consistent interval.
3. **Save or temporarily store frames** with timestamps or indices for traceability in the pipeline.
4. **Pass each frame** to the first classifier for further processing.

## üß† **PHASE 2: CLASSIFIER 1 ‚Äì PEOPLE VIEW vs PRESENTATION VIEW**

### **Objective:**

Classify each extracted frame as either:

* A video meeting grid with people
* A presentation/slide or screen-share content

### **Steps:**

1. **Define label schema** for training: `["people", "presentation"]`.
2. **Curate small but diverse dataset** of labeled frames showing people vs presentation content.
3. **Select a lightweight pre-trained model** (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet18, or EfficientNet-B0).
4. **Fine-tune final classification layers** on the labeled dataset using transfer learning.
5. **Deploy model locally** and perform inference on each frame.
6. **Route output:**

   * If classified as `people`: discard or tag and store metadata (e.g., "human-focused, no slide").
   * If classified as `presentation`: forward the frame for further visual/textual analysis.

## üßπ **PHASE 3: DISCARDING DUPLICATE FRAMES**

### **Objective:**

Eliminate redundant frames by checking visual and/or textual similarity. Only retain distinct content-relevant frames to optimize processing.

### **Steps:**

1. **Compare consecutive frames using visual hash algorithms** (e.g., perceptual hash `phash`).
2. **Define threshold for image similarity** to flag duplicates.
3. **Use previously extracted text (OCR)** and compute textual similarity (e.g., fuzzy match or embedding cosine similarity).
4. **Keep a frame only if**:

   * It is visually different from previous frame **or**
   * Its OCR-extracted text is significantly different from prior frames
5. **Maintain a history buffer** of recent unique frames for reference.

## üß† **PHASE 4: CLASSIFIER 2 ‚Äì TEXT-ONLY SLIDE vs VISUAL DIAGRAM SLIDE**

### **Objective:**

Within presentation frames, identify whether a slide contains **only textual content** or **text + graphical elements (charts, diagrams, illustrations)**.

### **Steps:**

1. **Define label schema**: `["text_only", "image_diagram"]`.
2. **Prepare dataset** of presentation slide images (screenshots of slides) with these two labels.
3. **Choose a small, efficient model** suited for distinguishing visuals (e.g., MobileNetV3-Small, SqueezeNet, TinyViT).
4. **Train on the dataset** or fine-tune on pre-trained features.
5. **Classify each presentation frame**:

   * `text_only` ‚Üí treated as textual context
   * `image_diagram` ‚Üí treated as mixed visual context
6. **Store label along with frame** metadata for further processing.

## üß† **PHASE 5: CONTEXT GENERATION (ONLY FOR PRESENTATION FRAMES)**

### **Objective:**

Generate **descriptive contextual information** (not a summary) for meaningful presentation frames to be used in downstream tagging or analytics.

### **Steps:**

1. **Feed `text_only` frames' extracted text** to a lightweight language model or embedding model like:

   * `MiniLM-L6-v2` (semantic encoding of content)
   * BERT or DistilBERT (if deeper semantic roles are needed)
2. **Feed `image_diagram` frames (image + text)** to a multimodal model if needed (like TinyLLaVA or BLIP) for image + text context extraction.
3. **Generate structured output**:

   * Descriptive tags or explanation of what the slide/frame conveys
   * Structured categories or themes (e.g., ‚Äúfinancial chart about company revenue‚Äù, ‚Äúproduct overview bullet points‚Äù)
4. **Store output with timestamp/frame index** in a central metadata store (e.g., JSON or database).

---

## üì§ **PHASE 6: FINAL FRAME TAGGING AND OUTPUT GENERATION**

### **Objective:**

Compile and export all analyzed and annotated frames with their contextual labels and structured data.

### **Steps:**

1. **Collect all processed frames** with:

   * Frame index/timestamp
   * Classification labels (people/presentation, text-only/image-diagram)
   * Contextual descriptive output
2. **Format into a structured output format**:

   * JSON
   * CSV
   * API response
3. **Send for tagging, display, or storage**, enabling analytics or review.

## ‚úÖ Final Output Per Frame Will Contain:

| Field                 | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frame_id`            | Unique ID or timestamp                                           |
| `classification`      | "people" / "presentation"                                        |
| `presentation_type`   | "text\_only" / "image\_diagram" (if applicable)                  |
| `ocr_text`            | Extracted text (if available)                                    |
| `descriptive_context` | Rich description of content (from LLM or small generative model) |
| `tags/themes`         | Optional keywords extracted                                      |
